# receipt-ocr
- I could not get `opencv` to play nice with 3.8 so had to downgrade to `python 3.7.9`. After that, `opencv` and `pytesseract` were installed successfully. List of packages used in dev env is dumped to `py37clone.cfg`. 
- `receipt-ocr.ipynb` uses pytesseract for ocr
- test data is a multi-column block text lives in `img_data/receipt3_1.png`
- output from test data `output/receipt3_1.csv`
